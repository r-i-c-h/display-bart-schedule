# BART Schedule 1-Pager

Built to be a one-page client app without a server-backend (Well, except for BART's of course).

- Display the @trainHeadStation and @origTime
- Filter display by @trainHeadStation
- Dynamic update of filter
- Change station based on a `<select>` box

_Note:_
Not everyone likes ES6 destructuring in component arguments, but I obviously think it is more explicit than just writing 'props' for stateless/functional components.
